              <p className="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns black-70 baskerville">
                As a child, I was fascinated by the monumental buildings, the timeless ones that take your breath away leaving you with only one question: "How did they build something like that?".
              </p>
              <p className="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns black-70 baskerville">
                I often looked at houses and fantasized about how to do one. These trivial observations began to evolve and at middle school, when I started the Technical Drawing lessons, I was really taken by it. Then, when I got to high school, I chose to attend a Technical Institute for Surveyors where I get a diploma in surveying in 2013. The same year, I enrolled at the University of Florence to obtain a five-year degree in Architecture.

              <p className="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns black-70 baskerville">
                Almost five years have passed since then and soon I will also have completed this educational path thanks of whom Iâ€™m better understanding witch results achieve in the future. I am fascinated by all aspects of this subject, from urban planning to architectural design, especially the way of representing and communicating architecture.

              <p className="lh-copy measure f4 f3-ns black-70 baskerville">
                The latter, is an aspect that I have approached only in the last two years but which I would like to study in the near future with the intention of always improving myself.
